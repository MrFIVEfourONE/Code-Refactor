# Code-Refactor
Week One HomeWork UofO BCS

This is my first README and Repo created with github 
Im doing this all extremly behind in class but I am still here and going to try.

I carefully looked at the requiremnts for this assignment and went through each of them.

I cleaned up some HTML code that didnt seem nessary and utilized some seemingly forgotten CSS style elaments for the h1 part of body

I fixed one link

Re arranged the header to the right order.

Made sure each img had a alt discription for accessibility

I used one main branch and in bash used git add -A, git commit -m"",and git push

I left very dicriptive commits

Here is a link to the deployed page https://mrfivefourone.github.io/Code-Refactor/
